### Physiome Model Repository

Physiome Model Repository is powered by the [PMR2 software suite](https://github.com/PMR2). It contains the [CellML models](https://www.cellml.org/). These have been developed by researchers around the world over the past two decades.The PMR2 software suite is the combination of:

* The [Zope/Plone content management system](https://plone.org/)
* The [Git distributed version control system](https://git-scm.com/)

### libCellML

libCellML is a library that implements the [CellML](https://www.cellml.org/) specification in software. libCellML takes an object-based approach to representing the concepts in the specification. As such, it is aimed at supporting CellML 2.0 with the ability to upgrade CellML 1.x models to CellML 2.0. libCellML is written in C++ and is packaged and made available for use in Python, JavaScript, and Julia. libCellML also supports model analysis beyond the CellML specification and code generation for simulation of CellML models with tools like CVODE and KINSOL from SUNDIALS.

### libOpenCOR

libOpenCOR is a cross-platform library written in C++. It relies on [libCellML](https://libcellml.org) and comes with Python bindings. It is used as the backend to [OpenCOR](https://www.opencor.ws/) and is released under the Apache v2.0 license.

### OpenCOR

OpenCOR is a cross-platform modelling environment, which is aimed at organising, editing, simulating, and analysing [CellML](https://www.cellml.org/) files. It is released under the GPL v3.0 license and can be downloaded for Windows, Linux, and macOS from the [OpenCOR](https://opencor.ws/downloads/index.html) website.
Please have a look at our [published article](https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2015.00026). There, you can learn more about our modular and interoperable approach to computational biology in [OpenCOR](https://www.opencor.ws/).

### ZincJS and Scaffoldvuer

ZincJS is a Web-based 3D interface library based on the popular [three.js library](https://threejs.org/). It provides a number of classes /methods for easy access to powerful 3D models visualisations for desktop/mobile platforms on [WebGL compatible browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL). You can find documentation and web apps built on ZincJS on their website.

Scaffoldvuer is a simple web interface with 3D visualisation capability powered by ZincJS. It is currently capable of displaying 3D models format such as GLTF, STL and OBJ, and models from Zinc.
